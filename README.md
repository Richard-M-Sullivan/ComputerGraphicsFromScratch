# ComputerGraphicsFromScratch
Learning about computer graphics by following the book computer graphics from scratch.

# About The Project
Computer Graphics From Scratch is a book written by Gabriel Gambetta. The book
walks the reader through the creation of a ray-tracer, and a rasterizer.
Furthermore this is done using only one predefined function - putting a pixel
on the screen. Having just completed a linear algebra course, I figured that I
would be well prepared to cut my teeth into this book because computer graphics
uses a fair amount of linear algebra.

# How Pixels Are Placed On The Screen
I downloaded and installed raylib onto my machine, and will be using raylib to
handle all things graphics.


# Additional Notes
I would like to thank my dear friend Harrison for lending me his book, and
allowing me to hang on to it for way too long. he has been a major influence in
my wanting to learn about computer graphics.  For that I am very greatful,
thank you.
